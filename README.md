# Linear-Time-Series-Analysis

Time series analysis is a sta􀆟s􀆟cal method that is used to analyze data points collected over a period of 􀆟me. The main objec􀆟ve of 􀆟me series analysis is to iden􀆟fy paterns and trends in the data, to make forecasts about future events and to es􀆟mate the impact of a certain factor on the data over 􀆟me. In this project to perform 􀆟me series analysis, we consider the ‘qgas” dataset which is part or R package. The dataset contains the total quarterly gas produc􀆟on in Australia (in petajoules) from 1956:Q1 to 2010:Q2.
